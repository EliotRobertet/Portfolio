									<h3>Overview of the First Assignment in VÉL608G – Modern Manufacturing Processes</h3>
							
								</header>
								<p>The initial assignment for the course VÉL608G Modern Manufacturing Processes involved creating a website to serve as a portfolio for the course's assignments while gaining familiarity with Git. This website showcases the process of its creation, detailing the steps taken and challenges encountered along the way.</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Preparation and Research</h3>
								
								</header>
								<p>Before starting the website, I carefully reviewed the <a href="https://haskoliislands.instructure.com/courses/33802/assignments/149296" target="_blank">assignment description</a>, watched related tutorial videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and studied a comprehensive guide on HTML available at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools</a>. These resources provided a solid foundation for understanding the requirements and technical aspects of the project.</p>
								<p>With a clear vision of how I wanted the website to appear, I proceeded to download the recommended tools for the assignment. I installed <a href="https://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, a user-friendly code editor offering a live preview feature, which was instrumental in the website's development. Additionally, I created a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> to host the website and installed <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git Bash</a> from Git to upload the project files to a repository.</p>
								<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
								<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGuNTpc293hpIpAVSJ3-SgNolCTa1BfJE" target="_blank" class="button" style="display: inline-block; padding: 15px 30px; font-size: 18px; background-color: darkred; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;">Youtube video of the teacher's instructions</a>
								</div>
								<h3>Development Process</h3>
								<p>Once the preparation phase was complete, I focused on selecting a suitable website template from <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank">HTML5UP</a>. My primary goal was to find a template that was simple, visually appealing, and functional, including a drop-down menu to organize and access all assignments. I selected the Landed template, which aligned perfectly with these criteria.
									I downloaded the template and began refining it using Brackets. The customization process included:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Removed unnecessary sections from the homepage and added relevant ones to meet the project requirements.</li>
								<li>Created individual HTML files for each subpage and linked them appropriately in the drop-down menu and "Learn More" buttons.</li>
								<li>Updated all placeholder texts on the homepage and menu to reflect the purpose and content of the portfolio.</li>
								<li>Linked footer icons to their corresponding destinations on every page.</li>
</ul>
								<section>
								<h4>Image Editing and Processing</h4>
								<p>To prepare images for the website, we primarily used the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b" target="_blank">Snipping tool</a> in Windows to capture screenshots. Afterward, we used the standard image editing tool in Windows to resize and adjust the images to fit the layout of the website. This ensured that the images loaded quickly while maintaining quality.</p>
								</section>

								<section>
								<h4>Additional Tools and Resources</h4>
								<p>While working on the assignment, we discovered and used <a href="https://phcode.io/#/home" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, which is the new version of Brackets. It provided a user-friendly interface and helpful features for coding and refining the website. The most helpful feature being live preview which allows you to edit the html in real time, in the same window. Also when double clicking in the html file you could locate that text/button or image in the html code, which made editing the code a breeze.</p>
								</section>
								<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
								<img src="images/phoenix_code.png" alt="Phoenix editor in action" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;" />
								<p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray; margin-top: 10px;">
									Phoenix is a modern, updated version of Brackets, providing a clean and intuitive interface for coding and refining projects like this website.
								</p>
								</div>

								

								<h3>The CV</h3>
								<p>The assignment required linking a CV to the website. To achieve this, I uploaded my CV in PDF format to the project folder and created a button on the homepage that links to the file. Below is the HTML code used to implement the button:</p>
								<pre><code>
&lt;a href="cv.pdf" class="button primary" target="_blank"&gt;View My CV&lt;/a&gt;
								</code></pre>
								<a href="Eliot_Robertet_CV.pdf" class="button primary" target="_blank">View My CV</a>

								<p>When the button is clicked, it opens the CV in a new tab, ensuring easy access without navigating away from the main website. This approach provides a professional and user-friendly way to share the CV with visitors.</p>
								<div class="col-12">
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src="images/mynd_af_CV.png" alt="CV Preview" />
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">The CV in question</p>
							</div>
								<h3>Publishing the website </h3>
								<p>After completing the design of my website, I published it by uploading the project to GitHub using Git Bash. First, I created a <a href="https://github.com/EliotRobertet/Portfolio.git" target="_blank">repository</a> on GitHub, set it to public, and assigned it an appropriate name. Next, I opened Git Bash, which I had installed during the preparation phase, directly in the website’s directory. To do this, I right-clicked inside the website’s folder and selected "Open Git Bash here."</p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src="images/Git_bash.png" alt="CV Preview" />
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">Here you can see that you have to right click in the folder and select: "Open Git Bash here"</p><section>
    <h3>Uploading the Website to GitHub Using Git Bash</h3>
    <p>Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of how I uploaded my website to GitHub using Git Bash. Each step is accompanied by the corresponding command or action.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/code.png" alt="Picture of Git Bash Code" width="300" />
    <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">This is a picture of the Git Bash code, which will be described later on.</p>
</div>


    <h4>Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository</h4>
    <p>To begin, I opened Git Bash in the folder containing my website files and initialized a Git repository. This sets up Git tracking for the folder.</p>
    <pre><code>
git init
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Step 2: Link the Repository to GitHub</h4>
    <p>I created a new repository on GitHub and linked it to my local repository using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>
git remote add origin https://github.com/EliotRobertet/Portfolio.git
   </code> </pre>
    <p>To confirm the link, I checked the remote repositories with:</p>
    <pre><code>
git remote -v
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Step 3: Stage All Files</h4>
    <p>I staged all files in my directory to prepare them for the initial commit. The command I used ensures all files in the directory are included:</p>
    <pre><code>
git add .
   </code> </pre>

    <h4>Step 4: Commit the Files</h4>
    <p>I committed the staged files with a descriptive message. Initially, I encountered an error due to the absence of author identity configuration:</p>
    <pre><code>
git commit -m "Initial commit: Upload website files"
    </code></pre>
    <p>To resolve the issue, I set my global username and email configuration:</p>
    <pre><code>
git config --global user.name "EliotRobertet"
git config --global user.email "eliot210203@gmail.com"
   </code> </pre>
    <p>After setting the identity, I successfully committed the files:</p>
    <pre><code>
git commit -m "Initial commit: Upload website files"
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Step 5: Push the Files to GitHub</h4>
    <p>Finally, I pushed the committed files to the GitHub repository using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>
git push -u origin master
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Step 6: Verify the Upload</h4>
    <p>I visited my repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/EliotRobertet/Portfolio" target="_blank">https://github.com/EliotRobertet/Portfolio</a>) to confirm that all files were successfully uploaded.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This process efficiently uploaded my website files to GitHub while maintaining version control using Git. The commands and configurations ensure seamless updates in the future.</p>
</section>

<h3>Deploying the page</h3>

								
								<p>After successfully pushing the files using Git Bash, they will appear in the repository you created on GitHub. To publish the website, navigate to Settings &gt; Pages in the repository. Ensure that the main branch is selected and that the root folder is specified. Once these settings are saved, a link to your live website will be generated. If it does not appear immediately, refresh the settings page to view the link.
</p>
								
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; max-width: 45%;">
        <img src="images/Root.png" alt="Description of Picture 1" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">The master branch is selected and the root folder.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1; max-width: 45%;">
        <img src="images/websitegoinglive.png" alt="Description of Picture 2" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Here you can see the website is going live.</p>

    <h3>How We Updated the Website Using Git Bash</h3>
    <p>As part of the assignment, we learned how to update the website efficiently using Git Bash. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how we pushed updates to the repository and deployed them to the live site:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Opened Git Bash:</strong> 
            After making changes to the website files, we navigated to the project folder, right-clicked inside the folder, and selected <em>"Open Git Bash here."</em>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 10px 0;">
        <img src="images/Git_bash.png" alt="Opening Git Bash in folder" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;" />
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Here you can see again how to open the Git Bash program for your folder</p>
    </div>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>
            <strong>Staged the changes:</strong> 
            We used the following command to add all modified files to the staging area:
            <pre><code>git add .</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Committed the changes:</strong> 
            To keep track of what was updated, we wrote a descriptive commit message using the following command:
            <pre><code>git commit -m "Updated the website layout and added a new section"</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pushed the changes:</strong> 
            Once committed, we pushed the updates to the GitHub repository using:
            <pre><code>git push</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verified the updates:</strong> 
            Finally, we visited the live site to confirm that all the changes had been successfully applied.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With this process, we could update the website and upload it again, without too much fuss.</p>

    <h3>Final Words</h3>
    <p>This assignment was a great introduction to building websites and getting hands-on experience with tools like Git and GitHub. It taught me how to structure a project, manage files efficiently, and publish a website live for anyone to see. While it was challenging at times—especially figuring out Git commands—it felt really rewarding to see the website come together.</p>
    <p>Creating this website gave me a solid foundation for a portfolio that I can use to store and display the assignments I’ll be working on next. It’s satisfying to have a central place to organize everything and show my progress throughout the course.</p>
